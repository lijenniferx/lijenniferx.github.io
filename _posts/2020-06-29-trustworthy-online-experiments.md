I've been doing A/B testing for a number of years, but wanted an accessible resource for leveling up my knowledge.  Several people recommended [this book](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Trustworthy_Online_Controlled_Experiment/TFjPDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover).  
Notes below are by chapter.
