Welcome!  I'm a data scientist at Tripadvisor working on various problems related to performance marketing and site personalization.  In a previous life, I was a neuroscientist studying signals related to 1) eye movements and 2) taste processing.  I'm using this blog to document my forays into machine learning and statistical inference.  I hope you find it interesting!
